LinkStateRouter_Simulation
==========================
The objective of this project is to simulate the Link-State Routing Algorithm. The program is written in C. The program takes a text file (as specified) describing the network topology as an input. The problem of routing a packet from source to destination host clearly boils down to routing the packet from source router to destination router. The program simulates the process of updating the routing table for a given network topology, computes the minimum cost between two specific routers and outputs the optimal path.
